# Odd Jobs Web App
---

## Project Overview

The Odd Jobs Web App aims to help Customers find people to do Odd Jobs on their property by pairing Workers with each job. The system will take job listings from the Customers and display them to Workers. Then Workers will select the jobs. Priority will be given to the Workers with highest reviews. Workers will be charged a 10% fee that is supplied to the Owner and be left with 90% of their profits.
