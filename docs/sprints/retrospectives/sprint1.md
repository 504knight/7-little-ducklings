# Sprint 1 Retrospective
## February 17, 2022 to March 3, 2022

### What went well
- Ensured even distribution of work and contributions to the project.
- Accurately identified tasks that needed to be completed.
- Establishment of base project to build off of as well as understanding of the overall structure.

### What didn't go well
- A few task priorities were askew. Certain parts of the project were started on before parts they relied on were completed.
- Communication was string in the beginning, but dramatically tapered off after we though we understood our parts and how they interacted. This led to some confusion.


### How to improve
- Look at tasks and prioritize those that later tasks rely on.
- Ensure consistent and meaningful communication to ensure we are all on the same page.
- Ask questions when any doubt about how components interact is not completely clear.

### Measuring improvement
- We will more consistently communicate what we are working on and what we need help with.
- We will indentify and prioritize foundational tasks in our next sprint planning meeting. 


### Measurement Criteria
- Try to communicate over discord at least once a day to report current progress.
- Tasks will be organized into a specific order of priority based on later tasks.
