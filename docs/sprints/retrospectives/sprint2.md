# Sprint 2 Retrospective
## March 3, 2022 to March 17, 2022

### What went well
- Collaboration via Discord about parts of the system that work together to display data.
- The distribution of tasks was very even. Team members felt as though they each had big parts in the program.
- Wrapping up the database models for good.
- Got everyone introduced to the CSS framework we're using.

### What didn't go well
- The database models needed a lot of changing as we implemented our plans. This may reflect earlier planning, or we just changed them as we needed to.
- Communication about team member's work and why some decisions were made wasn't always clear.
- Meeting structure struggled a bit. We mostly just reported on progress and sometimes felt that the meetings were unnecessary because we each thought we knew what we needed to do. (but didn't always necessarily, this is where better communication and structure could come into play)


### How to improve
- Stick to the original database plan and make sure we plan in depth what it should look like in advance.
- Chat about how we plan to use vital systems like frameworks and the database in person so it's easier to ask clarifying questions or give demos to each other.
- We could switch up who the scrum master is so more people get the chance to hold the meetings.


### Measuring improvement
- We will make sure that everyone is on the same page with how the different parts of the system interact.
- Make plans to meet with individual team members for clarification on or to learn about how they implemented part of the product.


### Measurement Criteria
- Meet with another member of the group if you need help understanding their code for any part of yours.
- Chat about any changes with the team before making them to the database.
