# Sprint 3 Retrospective
## March 17, 2022 to March 31, 2022

### What went well
- Planning code ahead of time
- Organizing tasks into issues
- Creating issues that are neither too small nor too large
- Writing functional code
- Communicating about features that work together with each other's code
- Communicating via Discord


### What didn't go well
- Holding frequent meetings (outside of when we are supposed to have class)
- We didn't chat about what things we did well or had gotten done in much detail.
- We didn't take detailed notes from our meetings. They were very rough.


### How to improve
- Have a specific outline for what sprint planning, standup reports, and retrospectives should look like.


### Measuring improvement
- For the next milestone we will outline how to run sprint planning meetings, standup reports, and retrospectives.


### Measurement Criteria
- We split tasks so that each individual had the same number, unless we felt that the difficulty of one was more than another and would be the equivalent of two tasks.
- Have an outline for the different meeting types and how they will be conducted.
