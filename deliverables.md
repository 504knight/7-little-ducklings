# Milestone 2 Deliverables

## Product Backlog
The Backlog / Scrum Board is currently filtered so that [Milestone 1](https://github.com/users/504knight/projects/1/views/12) issues and [Milestone 2](https://github.com/users/504knight/projects/1/views/13) issues appear on separate boards.

- All issues can be viewed from the [Product Board](https://github.com/users/504knight/projects/1/views/4)
- To see the Story Points of each issue view the [Product Sheet](https://github.com/users/504knight/projects/1/views/1)

Note: Between the two there are more than 10 items which is the requirement in the rubric.
