# 7 Little Ducklings - Odd Jobs

---
The purpose of this app is to make casual odd jobs simpler by connecting customer to worker.

## Workspace Layout

---
The main folder for this app is this repository.

All examples and reference documents will be stored under the folder "docs"
The plan will also be stored in "docs".

The Django server and all associated files will be stored under "OddJobs."
(That name is subject to change, I just needed a placeholder.)

## Version-Control Procedures

---
All team members have access to modify the main branch of this repository. Each change will be made in a branch, then reviewed by the team, and then
merged to the main branch.

## Tool Stack Description and Setup Procedure

---
We will be using Django because it is a simple framework that already includes most of the features
we might need and uses a programming language we are all fairly familiar with. We can easily
create database models using the built-in SQLite database.

## Build Instructions

---
Clone the project using any Unix-based command line using the command `git clone https://github.
com/504knight/7-little-ducklings.git`

If Django is not installed, run `python -m pip install Django`

To start the server, go into the "OddJobs" folder and run `python manage.py runserver`

To see the server work, open a browser and go to localhost:8000.
